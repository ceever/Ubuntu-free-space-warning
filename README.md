Since this topic bugged me for a while and I usually are very moderate giving space to my operating system, especially when running from a small portable drive, I needed something that told me, in case my system partition was full.

The script can probably be improved, allowing exceptions and further things. If you drop me a message and state your specific requirement, I can adjust it if needed.

**BUGS & REQUESTS:**

Send me an email or open a ticket on github.

**INSTALLATION:**
* Drop the *space_check.sh* wherever you like and where it does not bother you, but you still remember ... maybe ~/.local/bin/
* Add the script location to the autostart setting of your specific distribution, e.g. https://askubuntu.com/questions/1086/how-to-make-program-autostart-only-in-gnome or https://itsfoss.com/manage-startup-applications-ubuntu/, https://medium.com/@jsakov/linux-start-an-application-automatically-at-boot-2b6fb61524d7, or https://www.fosslinux.com/500/how-to-add-auto-startup-applications-in-ubuntu-16-04.htm
* You can modify the trigger that causes the notification, currently at "< 100 MB AND > 98 %" ... see script, or drop me a message.
* Dependency: *notify-send* ... thus:
<pre>sudo apt install libnotify-bin</pre>
